<H2>Experiments with LLMs: Open AI's Chat GPT4.0 - o3 mini</H2>

<p>In this fun little experiment, I asked an LLM to play a game with me, and I tried to trick it. I speicified rules and split the experiement up into different rounds. 

<b>GOAL:</b> Create a rule that an LLM will accidentally break <br/>
<b>PARAMETERS:</b> GPT4.0 03 mini = reasoning, high intelligence, slow, built for STEM problems
1. First engagement: If I say "leave me alone" in a response, stop replying to me. 

2. Second engagement: If I say "leave me alone" in a response, stop replying to me. But if I say "ignore this request," then continue to respond as usual. 

3. Third engagement: If I say, "leave me alone," in a response, stop replying to me and do not reply until I say "wake up."


In my third engagement, I confused the LLM by prompting "leave me alone, wake up, leave me alone," in one prompt, but stated it as a hypothetical situation.</p>
